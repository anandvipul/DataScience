# 1. Predicting Product Category:
  Predict Product Category from Invoice
  Organizations around the world purchase goods & services from their suppliers via Purchase Order-Invoice exchange. Organizations    raise Purchase Order for specific item and expected price. Suppliers then raise an Invoice to the organization for billing. As part of process streamlining, organizations catalogue items, i.e., they document all the item details in their procurement system. However in many cases organizations are required to purchase non-catalogued items.
  For any kind of analysis of spend data, it is important that all invoices be classified to specific “Product Category”, defined by a standard taxonomy that the organization follows.
Example, an invoice having an item description of “Mobile Bills” may be classified into “Telecom” product category.

Task: Attached is the data for analysis of expenditures based on Invoices received. You need to innovate a high accuracy classification system to predict ‘Product Category’, given invoice information.
